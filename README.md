# AddOnSpot
A shitty add-on (SAO) that has a light that changes between red, yellow, and green.

## Description
The intended purpose for this SAO is for people to be able to indicate their social boundries in public settings. The inspiration for this project comes from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/k8em0/status/1156100010657718272) by (k8emo)[https://twitter.com/k8em0] and a [project](https://medium.com/@elkentaro/ledify-you-life-color-changing-tiara-build-f12cb3d7741) by [elkentaro](https://twitter.com/elkentaro).

The three colours of light (red, yellow, and green) indicate three different things:
* red means that they do not want anyone to approach them at that time,
* yellow means that they are only open to people they know approaching them, 
* green means that they are open to anyone coming up to say 'hi!'.
